          <h1>M & D Farm put Profit before People</h1>
          <p>My fiance and I contracted with M & D Farm to host our Summer 2020 wedding for August 1, 2020. Even though we visited the venue in the middle of winter, we knew this would be the place to celebrate our special day with family and friends. We also thought that Mario and Daniel, the couple that owns and and operates the property, would make this day spectacular. We couldn't have been more wrong.</p>
          <p>When SAR-COV-2 had its first case of community transmission in the United States, I knew things were going to get very, very bad. As a HS science teacher, I was aware of what it would mean to have a novel coronavirus that was spread through the air. In a time of a public health crisis, I knew hosting a wedding of ~150 guests would be tremendously irresponsible and potentially deadly.<p>
          <p>As most of the world was in denial at the beginning of March 2020, we were proactive and reached out to the venue to postpone until Summer 2021. On a phone call, Mario and Daniel stated we were overreacting and were the first couple from the 2020 season to even reach out. They assuaged my fiance and told her everything was okay. In fact, M&D would be able to weather the storm <emph>if</emph> weddings of the season were canceled because they were in good financial health, but that they had more concerned for their vendor partners. They said in the phone call they would pencil us in for the same weekend in Summer 2021 of our wedding and that we would check back in soon.</p>
          <p>Little did we know this would be the last time M&D treated us like the valued clients they purported we were</p>
          <p>In the ensuing weeks, COVID-19 spiraled out of control and government restrictions went into place across the United States. Our state of New York took extreme and necessary actions to shutdown all aspects of the economy in an attempt to stop the spread and flatten the curve. The executive orders put into place by Governor Cuomo shut things down indefinitely with the conversation of reopening postponed until the intial wave was contained. It was leadership that put people before profit.</p>
          <p>At this point, the window of time had elapased and M&D Farm did not contact us. My fiance emailed them at the beginning of the week and they did not respond. She also called; went straight to voicemail. Then came the email that turned everything upside down</p>
<p>Mario and Daniel of M&D Farm chose to treat us this way. They aren't a part of a national corporation. They don't have shareholders to answer to. When confronted with a challenging time, they put profits before people. After causing anguish for months in what appeared to be stalling tactics, Mario and Daniel remain insistent that they are ready, willing and able too provide a once in a lifetime experience in the context of Coronavirus and the strict guidelines surrounding reopening. So while I doubt they will ever come to their senses and right this wrong that they have commited, I hope when others hear about how they chose to act during these challenging times they will have a better understanding of who they are going into business with.</p>
